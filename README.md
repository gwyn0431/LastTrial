# Last Trial
**Post-apocalyptic FPS game**

**Concept**
- Post-apocalyptic future, totalitarian rule.
- You&#39;re trying to become a member of revolutionary brotherhood and you have to complete the Last Trial.
- You&#39;re placed in an alternative reality to pass a set of battlegrounds (or overcome a certain threshold if set is infinite).
- You can use force or stealth to pass the battlegrounds.

**Rules**

- You&#39;re placed into a battleground and you must reach its endpoint by two ways: force or stealth.
- If you have been detected, you must kill everyone to pass to the next battleground.
- If you reached endpoint without being detected, you&#39;re allowed to move to the next battleground.
- You win after successfully passing through all battlegrounds or if set is infinite - play for score (with some thresholds &amp; announcements after overcoming them).
